                            <p>A slight problem with Harrow: amp#x200B; The whole concept about Harrow on a gameplay level is being an aggressive support who, well, supports but through aggressivity, unlike the other dedicated supports who tend to be more defensive. This leads to him being one of the Warframes with the most mobile behavior, since he permanently needs to either kill something or charge his buffs in order to be relevant, so he basically needs to jump everywhere searching for enemies. This has the result. This is the tale of Garrulus Septimus, an avaricious rat bastard whose only skill tree is Speech, and whose only goal is to get filthy rich. In the previous chapter our hero met his inevitable and much deserved fate at the sword-arm of honorable Uthgerd. And they all lived happily ever after. The end. Previous chapter (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/8g2imp/tales_of_a_travelling_salesman_part_3/) Next chapter (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/8hbi5m/tales_. So I want a passive ability like mana shield a somewhat common spell in fantasy RPGs  To sum it up you magicka protects your health so any direct damage is redirected to your magicka pool. If you run out of magicka you'll take damage normally until it recharges. If you ask me mages really need it. Some similar stuff exists other mods. In ordinator the energy shield perk does what i want but only for 35%, I don't really care about the robes requirement since its designed for a pure mage anyways. Stop reading if your name is Caz, Lemery, Tanwyll, or Jastra or if you are on an adventure to Rakul. So each of my players have "destinies" that I have planned for them that I want to unfold over the long term of the campaign. I also want milestones of these destinies to be accompanied with meaningful feats/bonuses to their characters that make them feel special. I would really appreciate feedback on what I have so far and ideas for some of the harder ones. I'll explain the destinies Thaumaturge, or THM, is the class pre-cursor for the Black Mage job in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. It has access to black magic staples like Fire, Ice, Thunder and Sleep. I wanted to write this primer because I felt like the class deserved it. I've played a tank in EVERY other game and MMO, from Skyrim to Dragon Age to Baldur's Gate to Aika to RO to TERA. This is my first experience as a mage since I wanted to do something different since the character would be wiped anyway. So I just yesterday finished a project in my latest game which was to become an unofficial archmage (all magic skills 100) before entering the College to do that questline. As there's been a few users recently asking how to play a mage start, I'll give a bit of a rundown how my character developed as well as random ramblings about the magic system. So to start it off, my req setup for this game was very vanilla requiem-ish, as in, I don't have many other gameplay enhancers like things Name : Nebaalu, the Immortal Intended Role : Ranged AD Bruiser/Split Pusher/Jungler Appearance : Heavily based on the Dwarven Sphere Guardians from Skyrim. His mechanical body is made of a pitch black metal and stands 7 feet tall, towering over most people. His head is a rough representation of what he looked like in life, but is distorted by damage caused over time. His eyes and chest cavity glows green and occasionally emit arcs of electricity.
